Ter info: 

onderstaand de status / open-punten zoals ik deze zie, mocht het niet kloppen of onvolledig zijn dan hoor ik dat graag. 


Rick/Mark: 
- restructure REAL category / subcategory
- specifiy Icon filter groups
- provide multi-language content for all menu-options in the mock-ups
- specify Machine / Parts, Delta / Van Dijk website setup / crosslinks.
- specify what kind of watermark is required for images

Rick/Marc: 
- determine google SEO requirements 

Marcel: 
- provide icons
- provide CSS / HTML design
- provide images for carousel, etc.

Marc: 
- improve machine detail
- add quote form
  
Further investigation/consensus required: 
- add undercarriage type as information field to REAL, and as filter to website
- add 'Available for Lease' as information field to REAL, and as filter to website
- add 'Available for Rent' as information field to REAL, and as filter to website
- add 'Euro/Tier' as information field to REAL, and as filter to website. How does this relate to EPA?
- add 'Total Weight' as filter, to be discussed with Mark Coolen
- add filter on location. To be discussed, i.m.o. not distinctive enough... i.e. what is the second filter field after location?


Note: I think adding new fields to REAL like 'lease', 'rent', 'undercarriage' should be a separate project. Otherwise we quickly add fields without condidering the integration with existing functionality.

Decided/Implemented: 
- aspect ratio images 1:1.5
- use of standard REAL category / brand for filtering
- brands / category descriptions must be lowercase
- main menu: about us, delta group (with dropdown), faq, contact, language selection
- Fixed: currently the stock selection is removed when going to a machine and back (BAS keeps selection).


With regards to mock-ups:

- covered by current stock-screen
  * quick search / advanced search 
  * filters / sorteren
  * zoekbalk

- chat: 
  * LiveZilla chat is not possible because it is PHP based
  * I have chosen https://www.livechatinc.com/ but other options are possible

- kruimelpad: 
  * does not work well with current 'one-page' stock screen
  
- afbeeldingen: 
  * BAS / Smitma use https://photoswipe.com/

- make an offer / contact-us
  * todo

- informatie over de machine
  * three information groups: general, technical and descriptions
  Note: I would not make three tabs.... just scrolling down is easier for user.

- "special items"
  * which machines must be shown here?

- mailing list subscription
  * this functionality is provided by mail-chimp and can be integrated

- footer 
  * would it be an option to add a 'Now in Stock' button to the footer in stead of all the brands / categories
  (loads quicker, shorter pages, easier to implement)
